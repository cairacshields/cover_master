# Updating the Server 

1. Make sure to update the direct remote GitHub Repo with any of your local changes. Steps can be found here https://docs.github.com/en/migrations/importing-source-code/using-the-command-line-to-import-source-code/adding-locally-hosted-code-to-github
2. Next you'll need to update the Heroku app repo. This is done by using `git push heroku main` which will push the code from the local repository to the heroku one. Steps found here: https://mysterious-waters-33133-7c241b07349c.herokuapp.com/
